# Mastermind

Mastermind is a game where one player makes a code consisting of a series of 
colors and the other player tries to "break" the code using clues provided by 
the first player about each guess.

In this implementation, the human player creates the code and the computer 
tries to break it.

## Usage

Navigate to the directory containing the mastermind gem, then use:

    $ ruby ./mastermind/lib/mastermind.rb
